PROJECT SYLLABUS, FRAMEWORKS AND DELIVERY DATES
Development Life Cycle (80% A --> 100% B)
  a. Specific Feasibility study 20% B
    i. (7Ws: Why, What, Who, Where, When, HoW, HoW much…, taking advantage of the LFA already done at the previous stage, update of work-plan); QFD to study relationships between customer requirements and technical features: categories to be taken into account: Functionalities (Services), Dependability, Economics, Environment, Ergonomics, Performances, Maintenance,…)
    ii. Quality Function Deployment
      1. Customer requirements and importance definition,
      2. System technical features
      3. Setting the relationships between Customer Requirements (CR) and Technical Features (TF)
      4. Computing TF relative importance moving from CR importance
      5. Benchmarking
      6. Computing TF relative importance moving from Quality Deployment (Benchmark)
      7. Identification of functions/services –> IDEF0/Use Cases
  b. System Analysis (IDEF0 [AS-IS, TO-BE] to study functional organization of the context, 10% B
    i. IDEF0 functional specification
      1. AS-IS
      2. TO-BE
  c. Design (UML: Use Cases diagram, Class d., Sequence d., Activity d.,…..) (20%B)
    i. Use Diagrams
    ii. Activity Diagrams
    iii. Class Diagrams
    iv. Sequence Diagrams
    v. State Charts
  d. Implementation (UML, Python, MySQL/SQLite, HTML, CSS, XML, network, hw, sw…..) (30% B)
    i. Client (Python, HTML, CSS, …)
    ii. Server (MySQL/SQLite)
  e. Operation (Prototype) (5% B)
    i. Demonstration of the Prototype
  f. Dissemination (15% B)
  i. Presentation (Pwp, Report associated to the diagrams, code, 2 video)
  g. Monitoring and assessment
